## What is spherical geometry?

Earth-related coordinates of spatial data can be either

- _projected_: measured on a two-dimensional surface, which is associated with a projection from the Earth's **surface**
- _geocentric_: x-, y-, and z-coordinates associated with the three principal directions, measured from Earth's **center**
- _geographic_: degrees latitude and longitude, associated with a datum (ellipsoidal or even spherical model of the Earth)

Geometrical computations on projected or geocentric coordinates can be done using Euclidean geometry, where all lines are staight.

Spherical (or ellipsoidal) geometry computes distances, direction, areas etc. over the surface of the sphere (ellipsoid).

## Why is this worth talking about?

- I believe that applying Eucledian geometry to geographical coordinates is the number one most common error made in spatial data science (closely followed by ignoring the support of data).

- technological advances have made spherical geometry a good option, but inertia in legacy GIS and data science languages have slowed down its adoption / uptake

- We have gotten used to Plate Carree, and are OK with it.

- Even GeoJSON has written down that the world is 2D.

## What is (so bad about) Plate Carrée?

Compared to other projections:

* every global projection is miserable in its own way
* it has true scale (1 unit easting equals 1 unit Northing) only at the equator
* it is hopeless at the poles and at the antimeridian

Compared to an ellipsoid, or sphere:

* It is 2D. The world is round, bro.

-----------

Consider, for a moment, the difference between:

* a flat projection of the sphere, and a sphere (1, 2)
* a sphere and an ellipsoid with 1/300 flattening (2, 3)

**Equirectangular projection**: where meridians and parallels form equal rectangles (left; true scale at centre), not squares (right: nowhere true)

```{r world, echo=FALSE, fig.height=6}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(sf))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(sp))
data(air, package = "spacetime")
DE <- st_as_sf(DE_NUTS1)
par(mfrow=c(1, 2))
plot(st_geometry(DE), graticule=TRUE,axes=TRUE, main="equirectangular")
plot(st_geometry(DE), graticule=TRUE,axes=TRUE,asp=1,main="plate carree")
```

	* part of Proj.4, now PROJ
* PostGIS (liblwgeom)'s "geograpy" type
    * [funded by palantir](http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2017/12/postgis-fund-me.html)
	* [feature list](https://postgis.net/workshops/postgis-intro/geography.html), 
	* but:  "_The buffer and intersection functions are actually wrappers on top of a cast to geometry, and are not carried out natively in spherical coordinates. As a result, they may fail to return correct results for objects with very large extents that cannot be cleanly converted to a planar representation._"
* R package `geosphere` providing distance, bearing, etc, and several alternative measures
* R packages `sp`, `gstat`, `spdep` using geodetic distances in case of geographic coordinates
* R package `lwgeom` interfacing `liblwgeom`

## How is spherical geometry different?

* in contrast to the plane $R^2$, the sphere ($S^2$) is bounded
* where in $R^2$ polygons have an unambiguous _inside_, on $S^2$ polygons divide the sphere's surface in two parts.
* the _inside_ can then e.g. be determined by ring direction (left of the boundary, when traversing the ring), and flips if the ring directions is reversed
* the _empty polygon_ has a complement: the _full polygon_.
* two new bounding structures:
    * bounding cap: smalles circumfering circle (center point + radius)
	* bounding rectangle: lat/lng range that might cross the antimeridian

## Plotting virtual globes

* Google Earth
* Google Maps: now has "enable/disable globe view" switches between _azimuthal perspective_
and _Web Mercator_.
* Cesium (can switch between WM, perspective and orthographic)

## Analysing data with geographic coordinates

### Measures
`distance`, `area`, `direction`, ..., bounding box, bounding cap

### Predicates
`intersects`, `overlaps`, `covers`, `touches`, `is_within_distance`, ...

### Transformations
`intersection`, `union`, `difference`, `sym_difference`, `buffer`


## How do we do this? Welcome [s2geometry](https://s2geometry.io)

* an open source library written and supported by Google, powering
    * Google maps, earth, earth engine
	* Google's serverless SQL engine [bigquery GIS](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/gis-intro) 
* provides all the measures, predicates, transformations
* allows several snapping to grid options, preserving validity
* provides, and uses, a spatial index by using a [space-filling hilbert curve](https://s2geometry.io/devguide/s2cell_hierarchy.html), after projecting a sphere onto six cube-faces of an [earth-cube](https://s2geometry.io/resources/earthcube)
